# NeoSearch

NeoSearch is an AI-powered semantic document search engine that offers lightning-fast, privacy-focused querying of large text documents. It allows users to upload documents, generate embeddings offline, and retrieve answers in real-time, all within a local environment.

Powered by FAISS and the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model, NeoSearch blends keyword relevance (BM25) with semantic understanding for highly accurate results. The application features a modern React frontend and a FastAPI backend for optimal performance and responsiveness.

## Features

* **Local AI Document Search**: Fully local, offline-first search engine with no external API calls for privacy.
* **Semantic + Keyword Ranking**: Combines FAISS vector search with BM25-based re-ranking for hybrid accuracy.
* **Real-Time Querying**: Get answers from large documents in under a second.
* **Persistent Embeddings**: Avoid re-indexing on repeated document uploads.
* **Multi-Window Chat UI**: Intuitive React interface with support for multiple concurrent query sessions.
* **Asynchronous Processing**: Embedding and chunking tasks run in parallel using asyncio and ProcessPoolExecutor.
* **FastAPI Backend**: Clean, efficient, and async-capable backend for rapid query processing.
