# NeoSearch

NeoSearch is an AI-powered semantic document search engine that offers lightning-fast, privacy-focused querying of large text documents. It allows users to upload documents, generate embeddings offline, and retrieve answers in real-time, all within a local environment.

Powered by FAISS and the all-mpnet-base-v2 model, NeoSearch blends keyword relevance (BM25) with semantic understanding for highly accurate results. The application features a modern React frontend and a FastAPI backend for optimal performance and responsiveness.

## Features

* **Local AI Document Search**: Fully local, offline-first search engine with no external API calls for privacy.
* **Semantic + Keyword Ranking**: Combines FAISS vector search with BM25-based re-ranking for hybrid accuracy.
* **Real-Time Querying**: Get answers from large documents in under a second.
* **Persistent Embeddings**: Avoid re-indexing on repeated document uploads.
* **AI-Powered Responses**: Utilizes Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct to generate tailored responses based on retrieved document chunks and user queries.
* **Single Chat UI**: Intuitive React interface with "Fetched data" buttons below each response that display source documents with PDF names and page numbers.
* **Asynchronous Processing**: Embedding and chunking tasks run in parallel using asyncio and ProcessPoolExecutor.
* **FastAPI Backend**: Clean, efficient, and async-capable backend for rapid query processing.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mayankrai449/AI_Search_Engine.git
cd AI_Search_Engine
```

2. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

3. Backend Setup

```bash
cd ../backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Application

cd ../frontend
npm start
```

5. Access NeoSearch

Open your browser at http://localhost:3000 to begin querying your documents!

## Usage

1. **Upload Document**: Add one or more plain-text or PDF files.
2. **Query in Chat Window**: Ask your questions using natural language.
3. **View Source Context**: Click "Fetched data" below responses to see the exact document chunks, source PDF names, and page numbers used to generate the answer.
4. **Re-query Without Reprocessing**: Upload once, reuse embeddings.
